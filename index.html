                <h1>HAPPY VALENTINES DAY</h1>
                <p>
                I wanted to make you a little something to show appreciation.       
                <br><br>
                You are amazing and I hope you are having a great time kicking ass in South Carolina!
                <br><br>
                I hope you enjoy the little montage of pictures I gathered up.
                <br><br>
                also those flowers are why I was upset you didn't have an actual class on Friday
                <br><br>
                but now you get fresh ones when you get home.
                <br><br>
                Anyways, have fun this weekend I'll be watching #13 :)
